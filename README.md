## RN Issues affecting the project
Â 

### Major
* SIGSEGV crash with ART library on Android [Github Issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6760)
* Orientation change cannot be detected between renders. [This package](https://github.com/yamill/react-native-orientation) solves the problem but has been abandoned and does not work with RN 0.35 only up to 0.29
* secureTextEntry is broken for *phonePadText* and *emailAddressText* [Github Issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/10678)

## Minor
* response.json() hangs when chrome debugging [Github Issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6679)
* [ActivityIndicator][Android] Indicator stays hidden if initialized as animating={false} [Github Issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/9023)
* Debugger and device lose sync [Github Issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/8720)
* Status bar cannot change before activity is active, RN does not handle the promise rejection [Github Issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6700)
